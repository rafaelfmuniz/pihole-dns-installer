🔧 What the Script Does
Installation Process:
Pre-check - Detects existing installations and offers reinstall/update options

Network Detection - Identifies network interface, gateway, and IP configuration

Base Packages - Installs essential dependencies (curl, git, golang, python, etc.)

Pi-hole Setup - Automated Pi-hole installation with custom upstream DNS

Unbound Configuration - Sets up recursive DNS resolver on port 5335

CoreDNS Deployment - Installs CoreDNS for additional DNS services

DoH Proxy - Configures DNS-over-HTTPS proxy for secure queries

Integration - Connects all components in a secure chain

DNS Flow:
text
Devices → Pi-hole (Port 53) → Unbound (Port 5335) → Internet
                            → CoreDNS (Port 8053)
                            → DoH Proxy (Port 8054)
